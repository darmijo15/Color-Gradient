Color-Gradient is the 2nd of 25 Javascript projects I will be doing.
Color-Gradient is similar to Colors. It features a clickable button that changes the background color of the webpage.
The difference is that rather than selecting a solid color, it selects two random colors and make a color-gradient from them.
